## Introduction

The numeral system of ancient Rome vastly differed from what is in use nowadays. There's no notion of place value, so individual symbols have a constant value, regardless of their position. Because of this, there's also no symbol for *zero*, as there were no places to be kept. Only later on, the symbol $N$ was used to represent zero, as in *nihil*, meaning *nothing* in Latin.

## Symbols

A few chosen letters of the Latin alphabet have been assigned with the following values:

### Symbol I

One finger, referred to as one unit. Similar to counting with strokes. It has been assigned a value of $1$.

### Symbol V

A held up hand with all fingers extended naturally tends to look like a $\text{V}$-shape, assigning a value of $5$.

### Symbol X

An X can either be made up of two $\text{V}$'s, joined at their pointy ends, or two hands with all fingers extended held up next to each other, crossing thumbs. Thus, assigning a value of $10$.

### Symbol L

Supposedly, the $\text{L}$ originally was a $\psi$, which got flattened out and malformed over time, until it ended up at $\text{L}$. Nonetheless, it has been assigned a value of $50$.

### Symbol C

While it's origin is unclear, it's coincidentally the first letter of the Latin word *centum*, meaning *hundred*, thus assigning it a value of $100$.

### Symbol D

Originally, this number was written as $\text{IↃ}$, (see apostrophus), due to the fact that it's value equals $\frac{\text{ＣIↃ}}{2}$ (cutting off the first enclosure). It also, over time, degraded into the Latin letter $\text{D}$. It has been assigned a value of $\frac{1000}{2} = 500$.

### Symbol M

Since this value was denoted as $\text{ＣIↃ}$ (see apostrophus) in the early days (which has similarities to an $\text{M}$) and the Latin word *mille* stands for *thousand*, this symbol won over. It has been assigned a value of $1000$.

### Symbol S

A rarely used symbol, depicting a fraction, is $S$, standing for *semis* and meaning *half*. It didn't stand for $\frac{1}{2}$, but rather $\frac{6}{12}$, due to the duodecimal number system of the romans. Adding a trailing dot increases this fraction's numerator, making $\text{S}·$ equal to $\frac{7}{12}$, $\text{S}··$ equal to $\frac{8}{12}$, $\text{S}···$ equal to $\frac{9}{12}$, $\text{S}····$ equal to $\frac{10}{12}$ and $\text{S}·····$ equal to $\frac{11}{12}$.

## Composing Numbers

Usually, the values of symbols in a string are added up in order to retrieve it's total value, but since $\text{IIII}$ or $\text{VIIII}$ are quite confusing to read, subtractive notation has been invented: If a symbol $a$ is prepended to a symbol $b$ and the value of $a$ is smaller than the value of $b$, then $a$ is subtracted from $b$, leaving a value of $b-a$. This also reveals the necessity to sort roman numerals in a descending manner.

Besides of $\text{IV}$ (4), $\text{IX}$ (9), $\text{XL}$ (40), $\text{XC}$ (90), $\text{CD}$ (400) and $\text{CM}$ (900), subtractive notation is not commonly used and should rather be avoided. These are the first twenty roman numerals, ranging from 1 to 20: $\text{I}$, $\text{II}$, $\text{III}$, $\text{IV}$, $\text{V}$, $\text{VI}$, $\text{VII}$, $\text{VIII}$, $\text{IX}$, $\text{X}$, $\text{XI}$, $\text{XII}$, $\text{XIII}$, $\text{XIV}$, $\text{XV}$, $\text{XVI}$, $\text{XVII}$, $\text{XVIII}$, $\text{XIX}$, $\text{XX}$.

The pattern of having to apply subtractive notation repeats itself over higher and higher numbers and - by using only the few examples provided above - every number can be displayed in a reasonably efficient manner within this system. Sometimes, for aesthetic or artistic reasons, subtractive notation is not being used and strings are fully expanded.

## The Apostrophus

An apostrophe resembles a backwards letter $\text{C}$ and was used in combination with the symbol $\text{I}$ ($\text{IↃ}$) to represent $500$, before $\text{D}$ was introduced. Encasing $\text{I}$ on both sides results in a value of $1000$ ($\text{ＣIↃ}$).

These two variants make up the basis for all larger numbers, as adding more apostrophes, the value is increased by a *factor* of ten. Multiples of $500$ are only padded to the right, while multiples of $1000$ have to be padded symmetrically.

$\text{IↃↃ}$ means $5,000$ and $\text{IↃↃↃ}$ means $50,000$ while $\text{ＣＣIↃↃ}$ stands for $10,000$ and $\text{ＣＣＣIↃↃↃ}$ represents $100,000$.

## The Vinculum

A vinculum (modernly called overline) is a horizontal line which - when put over a string of roman numerals - multiplies them by $1,000$. Two vertical lines and a vinculum multiply by $100,000$, likely meant to be $1,000$ worth each line.

$\overline{XIV}$ is equal to $14,000$, while $|\overline{XIV}|$ is equal to $1,400,000$.

## Adding Numbers

Addition is the easiest operation to be performed on the roman number system, since there are no carries to keep track of. A number is the sum of all of it's symbols, so just merging both numbers together, in sorted order, already yields the result.

$\text{LXXII}$ (72) plus $\text{MCXIII}$ (1113) equals $\text{MCLXXXIIIII}$ (1185), which can be compressed by making use of another symbol: $\text{MCLXXXV}$.

## Subtracting Numbers

Let $a$ and $b$ be two numbers written in roman notation, then the subtraction always occurs as follows: $max(a, b) - min(a, b)$. If $b$ was larger than $a$, a negative sign needs to be prepended to the result, but I don't think that the romans even used negative numbers. Symbols occurring in both $a$ and $b$ just cancel out and can be crossed off, while the remaining symbols require disassembly of some of $a$'s symbols to repeat crossing off, repeated until completion.

$\text{MXXVI}$ (1026) minus $\text{CXIII}$ (113) is resolved by first removing all common symbols between both numbers, leaving $\text{MXV}$ (1015) minus $\text{CII}$ (102). In order to subtract $\text{II}$, $\text{V}$ has to be disassembled. The same goes for subtracting $\text{C}$ from $\text{M}$. $\text{CCCCCCCCCCXIIIII}$ (1015) minus $\text{CII}$ is then resolved by removing commons again, leaving $\text{CCCCCCCCCXIII}$ (913) as the result. This number can be compressed again, this time through subtractive notation: $\text{CMXIII}$.

## Multiplication And Division

Any higher operations than to just add or subtract were always performed using an abacus, which essentially had a row for each value ($\text{I, V, X, L, C, D, M}$). The result could then be read out by just counting the number of stones in each row. Multiplication is to be performed as repeated addition, while division is done as repeated subtraction.
