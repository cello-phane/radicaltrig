<p style="text-align: center;">(You don't belong here.)</p>

I was born in Austria (🇦🇹), right at the beginning of the year 2001 (01.01., `:)`) and have been given the name `Philip`. After some years of wandering through the web and after many trials to come up with a nickname I identify with, `BlvckBytes` was and still is what resonates the most. My nickname links two words which are of great importance to me, one of them being the standard unit in information technology - the byte - and the other being blvck, which is an obscured way of writing black, with the a being on it's head. The latter is a reference to darkness, a steady companion of mine, having turned my existence on it's head numerous times.

I'm very open-minded and always give people or new concepts a neutral base to build upon, but I'd describe myself very much as a non-typical kind of person, as my interests as well as my drive in life vastly differ from those of most beings I've had a chance to meet so far. While my peers always loved to indulge in all the various stimuli and pleasures life has to offer, boasting about their "achievements", this kind of lifestyle has always repulsed me and induces a deep down feeling of sadness and disappointment. While I don't find myself attracted by physical appearances to any meaningful degree, I very much am attracted to people which haven't lost their curiosity and make use of their ability to apply logic to solve problems.

In order to clear my thoughts, I really enjoy to go for a run or do some calisthenics, but I'm by no means an athlete. I use physical exercise as a fun way to help me concentrate and view problems I'm facing from a different viewpoint, while keeping my vehicle operational. It provides a feeling of true freedom and rootedness for me. During summer time, I go for bicycle rides where I really push myself to the limit.

As I'm very much appreciative of not only having shelter but also cling like crazy to my laptop, I cannot exactly claim to be a hard-core minimalist in the typical sense. On the other hand, all of my long-term goals and desires cannot be bought with money, but instead require a mixture of hard mental and physical effort as well as a sprinkle of good luck. To me, the true experience of life takes place on the inside, within the realms of thought and consciousness. I am not one to go on shopping sprees or to dream about climbing the ladder of career in order to earn the big bucks. If I ask myself which lifestyle choices would bring a smile to my face on my deathbed, the outcome is always the same: finding like-minded companions, providing help to others and fighting for a better world, together.

## The Past

My teenage years were mostly made up of dark episodes due to my parents fighting all the time, being a social outcast, having health issues and most importantly: feeling anguished by my strongly clouded mental state.

A few years ago I found myself in the midst of rewriting my book of life. The first and most impactful propulsion came from a radical dietary change. The second biggest milestone on my journey was marked by the discovery of philisopy and - what I call - mental alchemy. I managed to finally break this cloudy barrier, unfold my free will and feel like I have an impact on the movie played in front of me.

"I was blinded and numbed out by the misery which my mental and physical ailments brought upon me. What was obvious or naturally given to others has been invisible or unattainable to me. This time has been lost and I have been scarred. May philosophy now allow me to heal my soul and body as well as to regain a multiple of my losses." - Philip Hell

## The Present

I'm still far from being able to unfold my true potential. On a good day, or rather during good moments, I can think clearly, and can get a taste of what I'm actually able to accomplish. Sadly, while the situation improved a lot, these kind of moments are still far and few between. Through mentioned dietary changes, I could notice a huge impact within my ability to think clearly within one or two months of consistently doing what I feel and know is right (a large set of theoretically and empirically derived insights). This lightness, clearness and wakedness opened a new space of problems to me, one which I would've never thought about: seeing the suffering of myself as well as of others on this planet more detailled, becoming truly aware that I will likely never be able to attain long-term happiness, not due to the nature of reality, but due to the imposed and artificial rules and systems in place. Because of this conflict, the longest "streak" of fruitarianism I've managed to attain so far was 60 days, where I went for an extended juice-fast. At other times, I use the wrong food (still vegan, (of course, I'd never go back,) but cooked) to numb myself out, and it makes a *huge* negative difference... The reason I do so is the exact same reason for why some poor souls commit suicide: they can no longer deal with their level of pain and suffering, the pain exceeded the beauty of life. I'm aware of some possibilities on how to break through this barrier, I still see light at the end of the tunnel, and I'm aware of how death is a one-way-street, so that's *not* happening.

Not only that my body still isn't up to the task, because I'm not permanently behaving as I should (in combination with piss-weak genetics), but I'm also still fighting with so many traumata and negative experiences which haunt me to this day, that I cannot seem to escape the ideas of my space, of my time, of my prison. It's like I'm trying to get out of quicksand, repeatedly struggling, but not getting very far. On the positive side, I've had just a finger out two years prior, while I'd be confident calling it an elbow's length by now, `:)`. Babysteps... it'll accumulate.

My traumata consist not only of how society has dealt with me, but also of how I responded. I've went down so many stupid rabbit-holes, made a fool of myself, spent time with people and concepts I never should have, and am now haunted by their residue. In some sense, I'm also holding myself back from breaking that barrier as a way to punish myself, as there's still some self-hatred deep down within me. But hey, at least I managed to stay clear of drugs and will never go down *that* route. Cooked food's bad enough, `;)`.

So, to make a long story short... If you read what I wrote on this page, if you read my code, if you look at my work in general, and if you're of astute personality, you'll see this mental anguish all over it. I'm sorry, I try my best. The reason for why I still put my work out there is not to impress people, which I not only do not care about, but also never will, but to maybe one day attract likeminded companions, so we can fight for what's right together.

## Favourite Quotes And Inspirations

These are in no particular order, and I'd have many more around... If it wasn't for these people, I wouldn't know where else to draw my inspiration from. Quotes which only unfold their full potency within the German language have been kept as such and were translated and parenthesized immediately afterwards.

"Since my earliest memories I have been depressed, both due to my suffering and that of others. I cannot begin to imagine how anyone can claim to be normal and never have suffered depression.

Und alle rufen sie im Chor vereint: Wir glauben nicht, dass oben Sonne scheint!" - Arnold Ehret

("On a high mountain peek lays hidden, a life without suffering, pain and worries. Through fog, clouds and grim depths it was only granted a few, to find the right path. Some fall off, many turn around and go back: in fear, renouncing and giving up life's highest bliss and happiness. Halfway up, and with half insights, everybody wants to convince and convert the world. And they all get together and shout in the choir: we do not believe, that there's sunshine up there!" - Arnold Ehret)

"Der Mensch hält nur das für schädlich, woran er direkt stirbt, daß aber jahrelange Schädigungen sich endlich zum Verhängnis aufstauen können, daran glaubt der moralische Dickhäuter, genannt Mensch, nicht, obgleich ein degeneriertes, bebrilltes, zahnarmes, kahlköpfiges, unschönes, trottelhaftes Geschlecht eine deutliche Sprache redet." - Heinrich Lahmann

("The human only considers that as harmful, of which he instantaneously dies, but that years of repeated damage may ultimatively accumulate into one's doom, that, the moral pachyderm, called human, does not want to believe, although a degenerated, bespectacled, almost toothless, bald, ugly, stupid lineage speaks rather clear volumes." - Heinrich Lahmann)

"An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity. A physicist tries to make it simple. An idiot, the more complicated it is, the more he will admire it. If you make something so clusterfucked he can't understand it, he's gonna think you're a god, because you made it so complicated, nobody can understand it. That's how they write academic journals; they try to make it so complicated, people think you're a genius." - Terry Davis

"Anregung von außen geben ihm die Werke der Natur und der Anblick des menschlichen Treibens, sodann die so verschiedenen Leistungen der Hochbegabten aller Zeiten und Länder, als welche eigentlich nur ihm ganz genießbar, weil nur ihm ganz verständlich und fühlbar sind.

"I've made some mistakes, sacrifices, my loved ones and even myself. But I have to continue, there is no turning back now." - Dr. Romero (Nightmare House 2)

## Interests

I consider myself a *world-jumper*, as I call it. There's no single interest I'm chasing all the time, but I'm rather going for "sprints" in various worlds of topics. Sometimes, these take only a few days or weeks, sometimes months. I don't constrain myself in any way, shape or form. If I don't feel inspired and motivated to work on something, I just don't do it, as I'd otherwise pollute that world with negative experiences.

Most of the worlds I'm jumping between are the following:

- Software engineering (plugins, web front-&backend, tools, libraries, applications)

- Electronics design (PCB-design, PCB-fabrication, front panel design, soldering, low level software engineering, automation, repair)

- Fabrication in my workshop (CAD-modelling, cutting, filing, drilling, threading, welding, spray-painting, etc.)

- Exploring math and logic (reading, solving scientific puzzles, building my own little library of knowledge - trying to learn from ground zero)

To sum it up, I'd say that I love exploring how the world around me operates and then use that knowledge to summon small creations of my own into reality.
