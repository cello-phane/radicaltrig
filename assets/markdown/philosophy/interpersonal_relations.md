## Definition

In order to differentiate between mundane encounters and true relations, I've developed my very own definition of what constitutes a relation. A certain threshold of depth has to be surpassed in order to consider the encounter as such, which rules out everyday tasks like communicating with the cashier, the postman, etc. for reasons of getting business done.

As life progresses, each and everyone of us inevitably constructs their own bubble incrementally, which is made up of their interests, beliefs, desires, secrets and goals, making for a zone of safety, a zone of feeling right at home. This mental world is carried around throughout all of life and can be fled into whenever the outside becomes unbearable, thereby being the most intimate and essential good one has in store. How detailled, how unique and thereby how practical this virtual space ends up being is solely depending on the amount of work and effort applied by its bearer.

Whenever one being allows another to gain insight into their realm and may even offer the possibility of taking part in it to some extent, they make themselves vulnerable, which is to be interpreted as a sign of trust. The level of trust is directly proportional to how shallow or how deep this granted insight ends up being. These two creatures now inescapably enter an interpersonal relation whose effects are undoubtedly [irreversible](#irreversibility).

In the spirit of two intersecting spheres, where the area of section makes for commonalities, I now define the value of any such relation by the magnitude of said region. Only through the power of similar paths, true empathy may take place. Only a soul which underwent akin suffering recognizes one's scars and thus becomes enabled to show sincere compassion. I claim that it is this exact understanding, which acts as the base for all lasting and wholesome relations.

## Chains Of Habit

In comparison to the seemingly uncountable amount of human beings inhabiting this earth, the number of relations a certain individual gets to make during their lifetime appears to be vastly limited. Most connections tend to occur early on in life, locking one into a certain frame of acquaintance, which largely leans towards superficiality, due to the fact that the process of developing a character requires the accumulation of experience and wisdom, which may take up to decades.

Just as it is impossible to learn new knowledge if you think you already know, the more one gives in to the soothing seduction of habit, familiarity and apparent safety, the harder it becomes to not only stay openminded about foreign personalities, but also to accept challenging paradigm-shifts.

Before any of these bonds and imprints take place, a person's potential has not yet been limited; they can be considered a blank canvas. The pain and suffering which inevitably comes with relations of any kind leaves stains all over, breeding scepticism, distrust and anguish. On the other hand, the state of having an open mind and thus being able to perform revolutionary thinking transitions into an incorrigible personality, paired with a locked-in view and static opinions regarding life itself. It is this exact process, one might call it degenerative, which robs the individual of their inherent greatness.

## Irreversibility

The process of establishing a relation is irreversible, which is why it is of paramount importance to choose carefully who one surrounds themselves with. Once another being took foot within the personal realm through the means of shared memories, a depiction of their perceived essence manifests as permanent residue. In the case of a lasting, or the alternative of a consensually, positively terminated relation, these shadows may be interpreted as pleasant recaps, while in the more probable situation of having been betrayed or disappointed, they unfold their ability to haunt and deal repeated damage.

Even if more than enough instances of wilful deception exist, most of the time, the fault for feeling betrayed or disappointed cannot be accounted to a single individual, but is rather to be attributed to a serious underlying problem which concerns many: [desperation](#desperation).

There is no limit as to how long one may be haunted by the shadows of their past relations; some even take them to the grave. Although I'm not certain on whether it is at all possible to get rid of these lasting impacts to the full extent, doing so should still remain a long-term goal, in order to re-liberate the true self.

## Desperation

Especially in todays society, it becomes increasingly easier to end up lonely or even isolated as soon as commonly accepted behavior is being deviated from or simply declined as a whole. Having to witness other people experiencing so-called "successful" lives, including friend- and relationships, can act bittering and may provoke a deep down feeling of jealousy and resentment. While it is the ultimate goal to expose the superficiality of these envied lives in order to break the illusionary spell of envy, this pursuit is almost unattainable by those still on the early journey of life.

Out of this jealousy, amplified by the common expectations of society, one is tempted to give in to the pressure and to then attain various relations just for the sake of making an end to their suffering. Resentment, anger, grief and desire all very much dull the senses, which increases the level of vulnerability and deformability present within this time-period. We now tend to project what the heart desires most onto whomever crosses our ways, thereby constructing beings of imaginary existence, who we then cling to or even fall in love with.

While such hallucinatory relations will feel right and valuable at first, it is not long until this self-imposed deception shatters, revealing the opponent's true face. A feeling of betrayal and disappointment arises, even if this predicament was not (solely) caused by the other party. No matter how the fault is being distributed, the result always stays the same: said relation falls apart in a painful and undesirable way. Lonliness reenters the picture, but the previously mentioned, imaginary version of one's opponent is far from being gone, continually nourished by common memories.

It is this exact experience that I attribute the character-trait of being overly precautionary to, which is nothing short of rational behavior, considering how much effort is required to leave such a trauma behind. Some people try to avoid having to deal with these residual memories and afterthoughts by practising what I'd call "*relationship-hopping*": displacing the remains of a failed relation by immediately entering yet another. Trauma which has not been dealt with will not magically disappear, but rather become ingrained into the subconscious, to bubble up at a later point in time. Wounds accumulate, until one day, the saturation-point has been exceeded and a mental breakdown will occur. Since the opportunity to derive insights based on past mistakes has never been made use of, these fallacies repeat over and over again, needlessly.

There is only one way which guarantees that dilemma like these can be avoided, which consists of dropping all expectations, initializing matters on a neutral basis and taking an ample amount of time to form the relation. At first, it should be nothing more than an occasional acquaintance, where most of the profound character differences begin to reveal themselves. Once this stage has been passed, chances are a lot higher that an actually valuable friendship may arise, to which said connection may now be elevated. If, and only if, after a long enough time-period of synchronizing each other, mutual feelings in relation to deep affection make themselves known, a relationship can be taken into consideration.

I'm convinced beyond any doubt that both friend- and relationships, realized just for the sake of attaining them, are doomed to become superficial and will eventually deal great damage to both parties. The greatest gift and the most sincere proof of devotion and care can be given to anybody without having to enter a relationship, merely by spending time together, by spending that which is the most scarce.

## Causes Of Desire

The following section tries to discern why we, as human beings, desire relations in the first place, considering their unmatched potential to deal serious harm; yet we persist.

### Egotistical Enrichment

There is a whole host of egotistical reasons as to why one desires to establish certain relations, which - in contrary to reasons of [Support](#causes-of-desire_support) - are strictly unethical and nothing short of evil.

The first being the realization of personal, unachieved goals within or rather through others. This behavior is not to be confused with a need for support, as supportive requests are always communicated as such, while the former makes use of psychological manipulation and thereby restricts the free will of one's opponent. It is highly unethical to utilize another (human) being:

"Handle so, daß du die Menschheit sowohl in deiner Person, als in der Person eines jeden andern jederzeit zugleich als Zweck, niemals bloß als Mittel brauchest." - Immanuel Kant

("Act in such a way, that you'll always make use of humanity within yourself and others as a purpose, but never just as a means.")

Other than that, there are various desires regarding wealth and affluence, be it money, power, influence, fame, glory or honor. Most people do not pursue science or teaching for their own beauties, but rather due to these greedy cravings, whereby others are again utilized.

### Support

To participate in the knowledge of others is very much a worthy goal, since profound wisdom can only be achieved by standing on the shoulders of giants. There is no shame to be had in realizing that a single lifetime is not enough to derive everything from scratch, and that we are depending on each other:

"Employ your time in improving yourself by other men's writings, so that you shall gain easily what others have labored hard for." - Socrates

Next to intellectual support, emotional aid is also of high importance to all lifeforms. Encouraging words or various acts of kindness can make or break a person during tough and hopeless periods of their life.

Last but not least, united workforce is also not to be underestimated. Whether it will be physical or mental labor, providing helping hands to each other often times resembles the very foundation of any large and impactful task.

At this point, it's worth to mention the importance of being able to forgive various slip-ups within reason, as hurt people hurt people; and we're all hurting in some way. The worst character trait one can cultivate is momentarily (or long-term, with some exceptions) finalistic behavior, where every action is being placed on a golden scale and all mistakes are replied in the style of "*an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth*". This way, peace and mental relaxation will never set in, even if both parties would presently be able to do so, as past events are always dragged along. Acceping sincere apologies instead of holding a needless grudge differentiates the naive from the wise. Throwing away months, years or even decades of loyalty and devotion over a butthurt ego is not only massively hurting the feelings of one's opposite, but also not within any healthy relation relative to the situation.

### Self Reflection

Human beings were reifying their thoughts in a physical manner since the very beginning of time, through either scriptures or drawings. A big contributor to the reason as to why we behave this way is that thought and inspiration are inherently volatile and fluctuating. It is not always an easy task to translate this immaterial and sometimes even emotional information into concrete words or sketches, which is where interpersonal exchange comes into play. By trying to convey a mental object from one being to another, a detailled description is to be crafted carefully, which forces one to rethink and thereby further flesh out the idea in question. While it is possible to still achieve mental constructions of arbitrary complexity for those of us who wield enough mental power and persistence, I'd argue that without said exchange, sufficiently complex mental constructions would seem impenetrable to most and their true understanding unachievable.

With some practise, another option is to try and challenge one's own beliefs by trying to mentally simulate how others would think of it, how they would react to it, and what they would criticize. In the end, though, this route will only take you so far. Entering civilized discussions with other real beings brings forth an opportunity to sharpen one's reasoning, and to discover illogical beliefs which are to be revised open-mindedly. It is this process of trying to move into a different point of view which attaches indescribable value to acquaintances with people of philosophical tendencies.

### Sexual Desires

The need to procreate, which imbues all lifeforms, is the one and only cause for a natural and healthy desire towards sexual activity. There are multiple factors which further limit the importance of this desire; factors which appeal to our ability of exercising reason. On one hand, offspring is to be taken care of for quite some time, while those who seek to create life should have managed to attain a firm grip on their own as a prerequisite. On the other, we have far surpassed the critical point at which extinction was a serious concern. Taking proper care of children goes hand in hand with sacrificing one's own pursuits, which adds to the importance of evaluating this decision well enough.

It quickly becomes evident, that the event of sexual intercourse only takes place a few times at most within any sane individual's lifetime; people who fulfill this way of living became far and few between. We are obsessed with sex as a species, by exploiting and misusing our sexual organs to derive sensual pleasure, which manifests in every major sector of human endeavour. While I attribute the root of this degeneration to malnutrition, and thereby to a violation of our needs, this is not the place to go in-depth on that topic. More can be found at [The Pinnacle Of Evolution](/philosophy/the-pinnacle-of-evolution).

This instance of degeneration is only rarely faced by countermeasures of any kind; quite the opposite is the case: society forcefully insists on the belief that the abnormal is actually the norm, driving many of those who would not fall for the same obsession out of their minds, bending their free will to make themselves fit. I went into a bit more detail at [Chained To A Madman](/philosophy/chained-to-a-madman).

A large portion of society values sexual activity as the most special and exceptional part of a relation, and through it, they define loyalty and devotion, by restricting themselves to each other. It seems as if attaining this level of trust is the main objective of every relationship and, once attained, a true bond is assumed. The fact that there is really nothing special to this activity whatsoever, as so many cheating partners and countless one-night-stands visualize, and that this level of intimacy can be obtained with a large number of people during a rather short timespan, now makes for a great illusion of synchronicity. If instead of common long-term goals, values and interests, mere bodily attraction dictates the choice of one's companion, superficiality and thereby a fragile bond are nothing short of logical consequences.

Personally, I do not manage to harmonize both true love and mental attraction with sexual desires and their practices whatsoever, which is why I chose to abstain from the latter, as to not stray from the path I've set out for myself, by becoming blinded and obsessed. This bias doesn't allow me to imagine how others might handle the union of these seemingly polar opposites, which is the reason as to why I'm not going to go into any more depth at this point.

### Escapism

To initiate this section, I'd like to quote *Arthur Schopenhauer*, at first using his mothertongue (German), which I'll try to translate into the English language immediately afterwards.

"Die Leere des Inneren, das Fade ihres Bewusstseyns, die Armuth ihres Geistes treibt sie zur Gesellschaft, die nun aber aus eben Solchen besteht; weil *similis simili gaudet*. Da wird dann gemeinschaftlich Jagt gemacht auf Kurzweil und Unterhaltung, die sie zunächst in sinnlichen Genüssen, in Vergnügen jeder Art und endlich in Ausschweifungen suchen."

"Their emptyness inside, the blandness of their consciousness, the poverty of their spirit, they drive them to take part in society, which consists precisely of such people; since *similarities attract*. They communaly strive for entertainment, which they primarily seek within sensual pleasure, delights of all type and eventually end up in excessive orgies."

It really is unbelievable how well hurt and scarred beings manage to boil the ultimate truth down into as little as two sentences. Since I'm convinced that every human being should serve their own, individual and worthy purpose within this world, I interpret escapism as a mean to suffocate the inner voice; a voice which regularly tries to face one with their own, partially self-inflicted, shortcomings.

While it may seem like a healthy and nice get-together at first glance, I like to describe these deliberate meetings using a metaphor: two or more people who pour out poison into each other's glasses while patting their comrades on the back, assuring them the correctness of their situation.

"The only good is knowledge and the only evil is ignorance." - Socrates

By escaping on a regular basis, by letting escapism take over one's life, by normalizing it, one's free will is effectively weakened, the shadow of ignorance grows, purpose is being further diminished, and evil gets offered an easy time getting a foothold within that individual.

### Conclusion

There is most definitely a natural need for social interactions and for community in general, but it looks like this need has to undergo adaptation in order to accomodate to the world and society we have so greatly ruined. It can seem impossible to locate those who are still able to exercise their ability to reason to a notable degree, yet alone to befriend them, but not all hope is lost ([Connecting Minorities](/philosophy/connecting-minorities)). This hardship requires turning inwards and working on oneself more than ever, just as it necessitates sharpening up the ability to discern who is in a state worthy of entering a relation with, in order to avoid further needless suffering.

While a relationship shouldn't be thought of as a mean from which to derive unconditional happiness and support, I don't think that one can achieve the same by being alone as they could when uniting forces.

As stated in [Definition](#definition), profound trust relies on mutual understanding and empathy. This level of trust is most definitely required so that access to the core of the self may be granted to somebody else, which becomes indispensable as soon as important and personal long-term goals with the aim of leaving a hopefully positive and lasting imprint on this earth are to be fulfilled together (see [Support](#causes-of-desire_support)). Thereby I conclude that it is important to keep the interest of finding people who match these criteria alive, as to not loose hope and thereby become effectively broken, while one's free will ends up massively limited.

Personally, I wonder whether it would be at all possible to be in resonance with another individual to a level which would enable both parties to mutually satisfy all their needs, all causes of desire, without the demand to outsource certain needs to friendships (not talking about strict business here). Such a relation would easily outweigh the sum of dispersed relations, as it'd be built on the strongest foundation of trust, dedication and empathy.
