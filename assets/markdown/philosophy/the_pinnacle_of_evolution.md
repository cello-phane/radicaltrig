The human species truly is the most refined, the most complex and, without a doubt, the mightiest lifeform evolution has brought into existence up until now. Not only have it's associates been given virtually limitless potential, mentally and physically, but we've also been liberated from the most gruesome cycle of nature: the food chain. Why that is, what should be made of this information and how our current behavior is nothing short of unworthy shall be the topic of this article.

## Limitless Potential

The basis for why our potential can be viewed as virtually limitless is simple and yet the main distinctive property in contrast to other lifeforms: the talent to make use of reason and logic, all while experiencing the slightest possible burden regarding our mental capacity, as our duties towards nature are kept at a bare minimum, see [Violentless Sustenance](#violentless-sustenance).

It does not matter whether choices are ideal initially, as there are various feedback-loops in place, whose result can be interpreted logically, and with the help of reason, course-correction may be carried out. This process of self-correction will inevitably lead to a better and better approximation of the truth, to the right decisions and the right views of various matters of subject.

Through language, both spoken but most importantly also written, we convey this state of approximation to our successors, who can then pick it back up and continue on the journey of further improvement and purification.

It's only when we decide to willfully ignore these feedback-loops, that we will enter regression and create long-term pain and suffering. This is the reason for why theory, especially philosophy, and practise (engineering, etc.) shall never become disjoint, as even the brightest minds will eventually self-destruct, once relation to reality has been lost, and so-called "progress" becomes a one way street.

## Violentless Sustenance

As by our anatomical characteristics, we as human beings are nothing short of frugivorous, which in essence means that we can not only sustain ourselves with nothing but fruit, the [Offerings](#violentless-sustenance_the-life-of-plants_offerings) of plants and thereby do not need to negatively impact the [Life Of Animals](#violentless-sustenance_the-life-of-animals), but also can refrain from hurting the [Life Of Plants](#violentless-sustenance_the-life-of-plants) and thereby completely withhold ourselves from hurting *anything*.

### Anatomical Characteristics

When considering a multitude of the anatomical charactersitics a human being is comprised of in an honest and unprejudicated manner, it is no longer arguable that we are neither omnivorous, carnivorous, grainivorous nor herbivorous, but clearly evolved to live and thrive on fruits, making us frugivores. While it seems much less of an issue to accept these characteristics when studying wildlife in a scientific fashion, we're blinded by denial as soon as the nature of our own species becomes the subject of study. Let's go over these characteristics one by one.

#### Extremities

Carnivorous species require paws with claws to hunt down and injure their prey, while omnivores tend to have a mixture of paws and hooves. Since no animal wants to give up their life and thus instinctually flees by running off as fast as their body allows them to, flesh eaters need to be able to outrun their victims, so they not only walk on all fours (which is far, far faster than bi-pedal beings will ever get) but also are enormously good at sprinting.

We have neither paws, nor claws, nor hooves, but are rather gifted with prehensile hands of great accuracy and versatility. While we can deal superficial scratches with our nails, we could never rip apart another animal bare-handedly.

#### Mouth And Teeth

In order to bite a chunk out of a whole, raw body, it is very much advantageous to be able to open the mouth big and wide. Analogously to claws on paws, sharp fangs and short but pointed incisors are key to rip apart flesh.

Herbivores, on the other hand, wield rudimentary and blunt canines with big and flattened incisors, while having very limited mouth-opening capabilities. They do not need to shear off material, but rather chew a *lot*. In order to masticate plant matter, lateral and forward jaw movement is necessary, which only becomes possible when the upper jaw sits on top of the bottom, while carnivores and omnivores have their lower jar embedded inside of their top and cannot perform such moves.

Due to flesh being mostly comprised of proteins and fats with very little sugars, flesh-eaters have next to no need of alkaline digestion (little salivary glands), while herbivores and frugivores own pronounced salivary glands, required to pre-digest alkaline plant matter. Next to this difference, plant-eaters also produce alkaline saliva, containing ptyallin (an enzyme used to split non-simple sugars), where as omnivores and carnivores make acidic saliva that does *not* contain this enzyme.

#### Digestive Tract

As is commonly known and easily observable, dead bodies begin to putrify rather quickly, which is why beings who consume such carcasses are equipped with very short intestines, ranging anywhere from 1.5 to 3 times their body-length. Complete digestion occurs within a very small time-period of only three to eight hours.

The other extreme lies within the camp of herbivores, whose intestines are roughly 20 times as long as their body is, while digestion takes anywhere from 24 to 48 hours, as herbs are hard to break down and require a lot of processing in order to extract nutrients. Since there's no danger of putrification or fermentation attached to greens, long processing-durations are not an issue.

Somewhere in the middle of these two peaks, frugivorous beings reside. Their intestines span a distance equal to nine times their body-length, with digestion completing within 12 to 18 hours. Since fruit-matter tends to ferment rather quickly, a fast-moving sewage system becomes of great importance.

Next to these obvious differences, a more subtle distincion is the fact that carni- and omnivores do not require fiber to stimulate peristalsis, while plant-eaters do. (Peristalsis is the automatic, wave-like movement of muscles within the gastrointestinal tract that moves food through the digestive system.)

Last but not least, flesh-eaters have the ability to metabolize rather big amounts of cholesterol and vitamin A (the result of assimilated beta carotine from plants), while the human is getting into serious illnesses by especially the former substance all the time.

#### Sweat Glands And Urine

For good reason, carnivores have very few sweat-glands that happen to lie on their paws, while omnivores tend to carry these glands a bit more dispersed over their whole body, but still sweat very little. On the other hand, herbi- and frugivores got an ample amount of sweat-glands all over them and may become dripping of sweat. When metabolizing flesh (proteins and phosphoric acids), great measures of uric acid and it's derivatives are released into the bloodstream. These can be partially compensated for by the consumption of potassium and lime through plants containing these elements, which carnivores consume none- and omnivores only consume very little of.

When sweat, comprised of mostly water, evaporates, heat is taken away and the skin, and thus the blood, loose temperature, while the body looses water and thus its blood-concentration rises. Since the ability of water to dissolve salts decreases with a decrease in temperature, and since the process of concentration only further lessens this potential of solvability, uric acid would fall out of solution, dealing damage to veins, arteries and organs.

Flesh eaters renally secrete uricase into the blood: an enzyme that greatly increases the solvability of uric acid. Herbivores and frugivores *do not* produce this substance, as they - by design - have no need for it.

Due to this inherently increased amount of uric acid within the systems of carni- and omnivores, their urine also settles on the acidic side of chemistry, while herbi- and frugivores experience great pain if their urine carries acids and are - rightfully so - considered being in an ill state if that's the case.

### Definition Of A Being

For me, personally, the umbrella-term of a "being" (a living thing) does - of course - not stop at humans, but also includes animals. But why stop there? Due to reasons discussed below, I also consider plants and micro-organism beings. All beings deserve to be treated with fundamental respect equally, no matter their apparent complexity or capabilities.

To illustrate where I draw the line, I'd like to take one each among the closest members of these two sides and compare them to one other. A being is characterized by depending on a natural set of needs. Stalactites have no desire to grow, or to ensure that their kind is well and healthy. Their growth is a mere consequence of a multitude of natural laws and if disrupted or destroyed, by breaking them off, no emotional reaction will be caused. In contrast, the behavior of plants vastly differs. The ability to actively regenerate is not solely owned by living things made of flesh and blood, but also well-represented within the realm of plants. It is the most obvious and most direct indicator of a will to live, a goal of not dying. When plant-tissue is harmed in any way, the plant's ability to continue living becomes threatened, so emergency measures start kicking in. This primary strive is to be honored and respected.

### The Life Of Plants

While the old-fashioned attitude of plants being mere automata still dominates the minds of society, their complexity as well as their behavior simply show otherwise. To still deprive them of their state as a being, even with the following knowledge in mind, would require to do the same to all animals, and ultimatively also to all humans. The only reason for why mankind very slowly starts to accept (at least some) animals as fully-fledged beings is that their sensory organs (eyes, mouth, nose, ears, fingers, etc.) remind them of their own and thus visualize inevitable commonalities, while plants require a greater deal of empathy to cause a similar reaction. Their complexity is just not directly visible, not fully presented to the naked eye, but still no less valid.

We mustn't forget that without plants, no fleshly creature could ever dwell on this earth. Meat-eaters may eat other meat-eaters, but at some point, a plant-eater will inevitably enter the chain, whose body is comprised of nothing but plant matter. Plants (and some bacteria) are doing on a daily basis what no other being could ever do: photosynthesis! They use light energy provided by the sun, paired with water, paired with carbon dioxide from the air to synthesize sugars - the basis of all life. Next to this source of fuel, plants provide various nutrients in the form of vitamins, minerals, essential fatty-acids as well as essential amino-acids, without which organs could not complete their crucial tasks. While minerals consumed straight from the earth are of no use to the body whatsoever and are excreted immediately, plants equip them with a special kind of "chemical tension" (for the lack of better words), also called "vitality", that's again crucial for them to be of any use to other beings. Once this "vitality" has been worn out, these minerals are excreted, so the cycle may start over.

Modern scientific processes revealed that plants do not only feel harm and chemically react to it, but that they also bear chemical memory and thus remember pain. Next to this behavior, they also communicate with one another, through their roots, by secreting chemicals into the so-called rhizosphere (root zone) which other plants, bacteria or other little critters may absorb. They all work together, supporting each others will to live, being there for eachother.

We don't notice how plants move, how they stretch themselves, how they adjust their bodies and faces towards the sun, how they expand and contract, just because these activities are too slow to be part of the modern, stressed out lifes so many of us lead. Timelapse recordings of growing watermelons, sunflowers, blossoms and many more reveal the "secret" movement of plants very well.

#### Defenses

Plants have evolved to defend themselves against other beings who want to cause them harm or dispose them of their life by a multitude of clever mechanisms, of which a few are to be mentioned below.

Flower bulbs, called onions and considered food by the human species, represent the heart of their corresponding plants. They store energy and thus allow the plant to survive the winter period, even if all of it's stalks and blossoms have frozen off. To protect their hearts, these plants store the alliinase enzyme within it's cells, while the cell walls contain the sulphurous amino-acid iso-alliin. Whenever the flower bulb becomes damaged, the enzymes come in contact with the amino-acids: propanethial-S-oxide, a highly irritative sulphurous gas, emerges.

Cruciferous vegetables, like broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, kale and the like contain anti-nutrients, intended to scare off beings which try to consume them. In contrast to nutrients, anti-nutrients block the absorption of nutrients and thus may deal great harm. They make consumption impossible long-term, if it wasn't for the unnatural process of cooking, which destroys the majority of anti-nutrients in plants, making them what we call "edible". Glucosinolates prevent the absorption of iodine, crucial for every cell in the body. Lectins (beans, peanuts, soy-beans, grains, etc.) and phytates (grains, seeds, legumes, etc.) interfere with the absorption of calcium, iron, phosphorus and zinc. Oxalates (green leafy vegetables, tea, beans, nuts, beets, etc.) bind to calcium and prevent it from becoming utilized.

Potatoes bear solanine right below their skins, a poison that'll harm it's predators. Since they are supposed to stay buried in soil, no light of any significance will reach them. Once ripped out of the ground, light-energy is used immediately to drive this poison into the flesh of the potato, slowly rendering it poisonous. This simple fact is why we're told to store them in dark and cold areas, as to trick them into believing they're still buried. Little amounts of this poison may cause headaches, diarrhea and or vomiting, while greater amounts will bring about cramps, vision defects as well as respiratory paralysis.

Spices, like the black pepper plant that contains piperine, or the chili pepper which contains capsaicin, are all to be considered irritants and stimulants which we misuse to derive excitement from. The body's response in the form of caughing, sneezing, watering the eyes or thickening the saliva are obvious, yet greatly misinterpreted signs.

We have genetically modified many plants to contain less of these poisons and anti-nutrients, so that we can consume even more of them without any harm. Since those mechanisms aren't only used to deter predators, but also parasites and fungi, not only the will of these plants has been broken, but also their ability to defend themselves. As a consequence, we're spraying them with unbelievable amounts of pesticides and herbicides, which again cause great harm to us, especially to our gut-bacteria, as well as the environment.

#### Offerings

Since plants do not want to die, and do not want to experience pain, the only fully ethical way to live off of them is to gratefully and thankfully accept their offerings, instead of expressing any expectations or claiming desires towards them. So, what do plants offer? Fruit!

The term "fruit", in a non-culinary but rather botanical way, is defined as the result of a plant's blossom. The plant itself has no primary use for this product and offers it as a present to other beings. Fruit can be harvested without any violence and in the most respectful manner possible, while plants will always ensure an ample amount of available produce if taken care of, and if planted in the right climate. This offering comes with a very simple, yet fully natural request of the plant: to spread it's seed far beyond the radius it itself could ever reach. A few seeds within the fruit may be - if large enough - chewed up, but enough will survive so that, when excreted later on, the foundation for a new plant may be layed down.

A symbiotical relationship comes to be, where frugivores and fruit-bearing plants help each other out, going through life hand-in-hand.

### The Life Of Animals

The conviction that animals are born to serve mankind either by physical labor, by their excrements (milk, eggs, manure, etc.) or by their flesh is founded by an ignorant and egotistical world-view, one that could never withstand logical analysis, would it not be for the fact that it became a self-fulfilling prophecy. Most of the so-called farm animals, also disgustingly called livestock, have been forcefully and or artificially brought into existence by people with the intent of exploiting them down to their bones.

Those lucky enough to be born naturally within nature yet still don't get to live their natural lives, as many people are convinced that hunting is not only necessary, but also a great "sport", a great pastime activity and most of all: fun to perform. While some small parts of the world start waking up to this lie, overall, we're still in great denial.

Judging based on shallow criteria, pets are permitted to live the "best" lives out of all of these tortured creatures, or rather the "better" bad lives. They are taken out of their natural habitat, bred to accomodate unnatural expectations, are sometimes fed the wrong food and or handled incorrectly, and develop behavioral disorders which we interpret as funny behavior and share on social media. We train them to listen to our commands and behave as we want them to behave, as if they are slaves to our desires, thereby breaking their own free will. Since many people keep carni- or omnivorous pets, some of them even multiple, it does not seem far fetched to assume that - on average - every other member of modern society keeps one, thereby needlessly increasing the demand for flesh and thus for "factory farming" animals. Further, they increase the demand to artificially breed pet-animals, so that the cycle of needless suffering may never end. While dogs and cats both have been shown to successfuly live off of a vegan diet ([study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5035952/)), this does not, and will likely not - within reasonable time, let their hunting-instinct die off, so they'd still be a threat to other lifeforms if let loose.

No matter how human beings try to utilize animals, they always end up restricting their possibilities and thereby the free will to live a life based on their own interpretation of life experience intensity and freedom. Assuming that we may prolong their lives in a gilded cage, who are we to judge wheter a life of 10 years locked up in a house and maybe even a garden is more desirable than a life of 5 years in nature, where they are free to roam as far as their extremities will take them and get to make many more impressions overall.

No animal has anything to give to humans, but yet we decide to forcefully increase their rate of "production", be it by artificial and forceful impregnation, by selective or even willful breeding, by fattening them up, or by simply slaughtering their offsprings.

## Conclusion

With all of the above in mind, there really is no way left to keep the belief alive that we're even coming close to making use of our full potential. We are plant-eaters, yet we choose to breed other beings that eat plants, just so we can then later on eat their dead bodies and thereby deconstruct other machines to fuel our own. We genetically modify plants we're not biologically adapted to eat, mass-farming them, making use of pesticides and thereby ruin the soils and the environment. We now have to cook our unnatural food, thereby altering it, which in turn alters us. We do not share our knowledge and our resources so that progress skyrockets, but rather keep it behind locked doors, discriminating others and disposing them of their intellectual potential. We've lost the synchronicity between philosophy and science, so that we are not even truly aware about the impacts great knowlege and thus great power has, ruining the planet which brought us about, which is our own home, which now slowly turns into our personal hell and - ultimatively - into our deathbed.

The only way to sincerely describe this behavior is as unworthy, unworthy of our potential. We have been given the greatest gifts of evolution, yet we've disrespectfully decided against them, rather choosing momentarily stimulation and excitement, ruining the paradise, ruining ourselves.
